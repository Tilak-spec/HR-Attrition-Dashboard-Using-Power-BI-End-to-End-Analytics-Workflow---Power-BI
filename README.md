Step 8: Drawing Insights from the Dashboard

1. Business Understanding & Objective
Employee attrition is a critical concern for organizations as high turnover affects productivity, morale, and costs. The goal of this HR Attrition Dashboard is to analyze employee churn patterns, identify key factors influencing attrition, and provide actionable insights for HR decision-making.
Key Objectives:
	• Measure and track attrition rate over time.
	• Identify high-risk departments, job roles, and demographics prone to attrition.
	• Analyze factors such as salary, work experience, job satisfaction, and work-life balance impacting employee retention.
	• Provide insights to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover.

2. Data Collection & Preparation
Data Sources:
	• HR Employee Records (Excel, SQL Server, SharePoint, or HRMS system).
	• Attrition History Data (Terminations, resignation reasons, etc.).
	• Survey Data (Job satisfaction, work-life balance, exit interviews).
	• Payroll Information (Salary trends, bonus impact on retention).
Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)
	• Handling missing values (e.g., filling nulls, removing duplicates).
	• Standardizing categorical fields (e.g., Department names, Job Titles).
	• Creating calculated columns (e.g., Age groups, Experience bands).
	• Merging multiple datasets to establish relationships.

3. Data Modeling & Relationships
	• Fact Table: Attrition records containing Employee ID, Department, Exit Date, etc.
	• Dimension Tables: Employee details, job roles, salary history, and survey responses.
	• Defined one-to-many relationships to enable efficient analysis.

4. Data Analysis & Key Metrics (DAX Calculations)
KPIs & Measures:
	• Attrition Rate (%) = (Employees Left / Total Employees) * 100
	• Average Tenure (Years) = AVERAGE(Employee Tenure)
	• Department-wise Attrition = SUM(Attrition Count) by Department
	• Salary vs. Attrition Correlation
	• Employee Satisfaction Score Analysis

5. Data Visualization & Dashboard Design
Key Visuals in Power BI:
	1. Overall Attrition Rate – Card Visual.
	2. Attrition Trend Over Time – Line Chart.
	3. Department-wise Attrition Comparison – Bar Chart.
	4. Age Group vs. Attrition – Column Chart.
	5. Salary Impact on Attrition – Scatter Chart.
	6. Job Role-wise Attrition Rate – Pie Chart.
	7. Filters & Slicers – Interactive options for HR teams to analyze specific groups.
User Experience Enhancements:
	• Drill-through to see attrition details by location, job role, or performance.
	• Dynamic Filters & Slicers for real-time data analysis.
	• Conditional Formatting to highlight high-risk areas.

6. Publishing & Sharing the Dashboard
	• Uploaded the dashboard to Power BI Service.
	• Configured automatic data refresh (daily/weekly as per HR needs).
	• Shared access with HR managers & leadership teams.
	• Embedded the dashboard in Microsoft Teams & SharePoint for collaboration.

7. Insights & Business Impact
Key Findings:
	• High attrition observed in specific departments.
	• Employees with lower salary bands and less tenure tend to leave more often.
	• Low job satisfaction scores correlate with high attrition.
	• Work-life balance issues impact retention significantly.
Actionable Recommendations:
✅ Revise compensation strategies for high-risk job roles.
✅ Improve work-life balance initiatives (flexible work hours, remote work options).
✅ Conduct retention programs for employees in their first 1-2 years.
✅ Improve career development opportunities for long-term retention.

8. Continuous Monitoring & Improvement
	• Regularly updating the dashboard with new data.
	• Analyzing the effectiveness of HR retention strategies.
	• Refining predictive modeling for future attrition risk analysis.
